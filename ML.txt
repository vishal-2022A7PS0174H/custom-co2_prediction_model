*********_______ TO PREDICT CO2 EMISSIONS BY BUILDING A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL FROM SCRATCH
________***

Problem Description:

We have been tasked with developing a linear regression model from scratch, without using any pre-built machine learning libraries.( Allowed numpy , pandas & matplotlib).

 The goal is to create a simple yet effective model that can predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. Linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistics.

Dataset: Assuming that we will be provided with a dataset consisting of various details regarding the features of a vehicle along with fuel consumption attributes. The task is to predict the CO2 emission of the vehicle using the given data


We will be provided with a dataset containing both input features and target values. 

Constraints:

● You must implement the linear regression model without using pre-built machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
● The dataset provided should have a sufficient number of data points and features to train and evaluate the model effectively.
● You can use gradient descent or a variant of it for optimization.
● Ensure that your code is well-documented and easy to understand.
● You are encouraged to experiment with different hyper parameters and settings to
optimise your model's performance. Accuracy :

To check how well our model performed in predicting the testing values. Please use R-Squared or RMSE metric for Accuracy.

Also, once we have built our own linear regression model, import the linear regression model from sklearn library and compare our model’s performance based on the metric of accuracy.
